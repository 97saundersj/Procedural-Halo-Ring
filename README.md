# Procedural-Halo-Ring
This project procedurally generates a 1/100x scale Halo ring using Perlin Noise and Fractional Brownian Motion to simulate realistic terrain features.

**[Check out the demo here!](https://97saundersj.github.io/Procedural-Halo-Ring/)**

## Features
- Procedural generation of a Halo ring with customizable parameters.
- Realistic terrain generation using Perlin Noise and fBm.
- Adjustable rendering options for the interior and exterior of the ring.
- Dynamic mesh generation and texture application.
